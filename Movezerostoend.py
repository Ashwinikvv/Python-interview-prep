# Python Program to move all zeros to end using two traversals

# Function which pushes all zeros to end

    # the front. Make all elements 0 from count to end.

Given an array of integers arr[], the task is to move all the zeros to the end of the array while maintaining the relative order of all non-zero elements.

Examples: 

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 0, 4, 3, 0, 5, 0]
Output: arr[] = [1, 2, 4, 3, 5, 0, 0, 0]
Explanation: There are three 0s that are moved to the end.


Input: arr[] = [10, 20, 30]
Output: arr[] = [10, 20, 30]
Explanation: No change in array as there are no 0s.

Input: arr[] = [0, 0]
Output: arr[] = [0, 0]
Explanation: No change in array as there are all 0s.
