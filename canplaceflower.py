Let's walk through the solution approach with a small example. Suppose we are given the following flowerbed array and n:

flowerbed = [1, 0, 0, 0, 1], n = 1

Following the solution approach:

Preprocessing: First, we add a 0 to the start and end of the flowerbed. Now it becomes [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0].
Iterating through the flowerbed:
We start iteration at index 1 (the second 0) and end at index 5 (the second last 0).
At index 1, the sum of the plot and its neighbors is 0 + 1 + 0 = 1, which is not 0. So we don't plant here.
At index 2, the sum is 1 + 0 + 0 = 1, again not 0. So we don't plant here.
At index 3, the sum is 0 + 0 + 0 = 0, which is 0. Here, all three plots are empty. We can plant a flower here by setting flowerbed[3] to 1. The array becomes [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0], and we decrement n by 1. Now, n = 0.
Conclusion: We continue the iteration, but since n is 0, it's clear we've managed to plant the required number of flowers without breaking the rule. There's no need to check index 4 and 5, as we already planted all required flowers.
Final Check: Check n. Since n is now 0, we return true, because it was possible to plant 1 flower following the rules.
Hence, the function would return true indicating that we successfully planted the required number of flowers without any two being adjacent.



class Solution:
    def canPlaceFlowers(self, flowerbed: List[int], n: int) -> bool:
        # Add empty plots at the start and at the end of the flowerbed to simplify edge case handling
        flowerbed = [0] + flowerbed + [0]
      
        # Iterate over each plot in the flowerbed starting from the first actual plot to the last
        for i in range(1, len(flowerbed) - 1):
            # Check if the current plot and its adjacent plots are empty
            if sum(flowerbed[i - 1: i + 2]) == 0:
                # Plant a flower in the current plot
                flowerbed[i] = 1
                # Decrement the count of flowers we need to plant
                n -= 1
                # If we have planted all required flowers, we can end early
                if n == 0:
                    return True
      
        # After checking all plots, decide if we were able to plant all flowers
        return n <= 0
