Scenario Based Interview Questions
1. You’re building a web scraper to collect product details from an e-commerce site. How would you handle dynamic page elements and potential access blocks?

Answer: I’d use Selenium with WebDriverWait and ExpectedConditions to handle dynamic elements. For access blocks, I’d try user-agent rotation, headless browsing, and changing IP addresses to evade detection. If that fails, I’d consider alternative data sources or APIs.
2. You’re analyzing customer purchase data for a clothing store. How would you identify trends and segments for targeted marketing campaigns?

Answer: I’d use Pandas for data manipulation and analysis. I’d look for patterns in purchase history, demographics, and location data using group-by functions and visualizations. K-means clustering could help identify distinct customer segments for targeted campaigns.
3. You’re building a financial data dashboard. How would you ensure real-time updates and handle latency issues?

Answer: I’d use libraries like Flask or Dash to build the interactive dashboard. For real-time updates, I’d consider WebSockets or SSE (Server-Sent Events) for server-to-client communication. To minimize latency, I’d cache frequently accessed data, optimize queries, and leverage asynchronous tasks.
4. You’re dealing with a large CSV file containing messy data. How would you clean and validate it before further analysis?

Answer: I’d use regular expressions and Pandas utilities to handle missing values, inconsistencies, and invalid formats. Data validation libraries like Pandas-Schema or PyPI’s “datachecker” could also be helpful.
5. You’re tasked with optimizing a Python script that takes too long to run. How would you approach performance improvement?

Answer: I’d analyze the code for bottlenecks using profiling tools like cProfile or line_profiler. Based on the results, I’d optimize algorithms, utilize vectorized operations, memoization, and data caching techniques.
6. You’re building a machine learning model for sentiment analysis. How would you prepare and pre-process your text data for optimal results?

Answer: I’d use Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries like NLTK or spaCy for tokenization, cleaning, stop word removal, and stemming/lemmatization. TF-IDF or similar techniques could be employed for feature engineering.
7. You’re building a REST API endpoint. How would you handle authentication, authorization, and error handling?

Answer: I’d utilize libraries like Flask-JWT or Flask-RESTful for authentication and authorization. For error handling, I’d define custom error codes and responses based on the type of error encountered.
8. You’re tasked with automating repetitive tasks in Excel using Python. How would you approach this?

Answer: I’d use libraries like openpyxl to manipulate Excel spreadsheets. I’d automate tasks like data extraction, cleaning, formatting, and report generation using loops and conditional statements.
9. You encounter a bug in your Python code. How do you debug it effectively?

Answer: I’d use the built-in Python debugger (pdb) to step through the code line by line. I’d also utilize print statements strategically, analyze error messages, and leverage IDE features like breakpoint debugging.
10. You’re working on a team project with other developers. How do you ensure consistent coding style and collaboration on Python code?

Answer: I’d advocate for using linters and formatters like Black and Pylint for code style standardization. Utilizing Git and code versioning tools like GitHub would facilitate collaboration and version control.
